# Bank Fraud Detection Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects aimed at detecting fraudulent activities in banking transactions.

## 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection  

This project uses the publicly available Kaggle dataset containing credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraud cases compared to legitimate transactions. 

**Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

The project involves:  
- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Visualization of feature distributions and correlations  
- Handling class imbalance with techniques such as class weighting  
- Training and evaluation of various machine learning models including Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression  
- Model tuning using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation and Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters  
- Evaluation based on metrics such as F1-score, ROC AUC, precision-recall AUC, Cohen's Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient  
- Saving the best performing model for deployment or further analysis  

### TODO :
 - Data Augmentation on fraud class
